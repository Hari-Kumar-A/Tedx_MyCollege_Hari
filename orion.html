        <h2>About Orion</h2>
        <p class="p1"> Orion, a beacon for students awaiting their offline classes as well as the rich wildlife on campus. Orion is the lecture hall building for students from B Tech 1st year to B Tech 4th year. It has totally 3 floors. The design and structures of each and every room is exactly same. The ventilation is really good inside rooms even during the peak of summer season. It contains approx 36 rooms. It is d
            ivided into 2 block. Namely South Block and North Block.</p>
        <hr   ><p class="p2">Undergraduate students who are studying taught degrees will conduct independent learning alongside lectures, seminars and tutorials. Lectures tend to have a high number of students in a big room or lecture theatre or lecture hall.

            They typically have at least one lecturer who will speak t
            o the class and has less interaction with others throughout, but you’ll adjust pretty quickly, maybe not straight from your inaugural lecture, but you will adapt easily.</p>
            <hr  ><p class="p3">Lecture halls vary in size from hosting 50 students to hundreds, and you’ll find even if there are lots of fellow students, you tend to sit in the same area every lesson. This means that you should weigh up the best place for you to sit on your first couple of lessons before everyone gets settled in their ways!</p>
            <hr  ><p class="p4">The front is handy for eager students who want to speak to the lecturer between breaks and after classes, or wish to have a better position for viewing and hearing the lesson. However, sitting at the front also places you in the spotlight for when the teacher looks around the room for participation.</p>
